## Fight-Sim!

Fight-Sim is work-in-progress rock-paper-scissors like simulator. A user is able to create custom entities (i.e., spheres, cubes, etc.) that can either beat, or be beaten by other entities.

The following features are *hopefully* going to be added as development continues:
 - Custom entity creation
 - Pathing for entities
     - *towards* other entities
     - *away* from entities
 - Moveable/Viewable 3D arena
 - Arena editor
     - Obstacles
     - Terrain adjusters (i.e. slowed areas, speed boosted areas)
 - Real-time graph showing group entity count as simulator progresses
 - End game statistics (i.e., Survival time of a certain entity group, number of defeats a group had, etc.)
 - Camera/Controls
